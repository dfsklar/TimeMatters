     details: <p>Prevailing theory suggests that all energy in our known Universe was condensed into a tiny area, possibly smaller than a single atom. It was hot, dense, a singularity. No one knows what surrounded it or came before it. Theories include Infinite Everything; Nothing.</p><p>An alternate theory imagines a Multiverse, millions of Universes-- fabrics or membranes-- vibrating in close proximity. As the membranes of two universes collided, our Universe, was born. It is possible that there was no beginning.</p>
